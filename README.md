A program to calculate how many years it would take to win the lottery. The user inputs their numbers and the program comparares it to a random set of lottery numbers.

## Usage
Simply run the program and follow the instructions. The lottery numbers can also be inputted as parameters when running the program.
After getting one or more matching numbers, the program will show you how many years it took to get to that point. (assuming new lottery numbers come out once a week)
